# Freezr – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 10 September 2025

Freezr is an offline, on-device app to label and track food expiration. We do not collect, share, or sell any personal data.

## What we do NOT do
- No account creation or login.
- No analytics, trackers, or ads.
- No data is sent to our servers (there are none). The app does not request Internet permission.

## Data handled on your device
- Items you add (names, dates, notes) are stored locally on your device using Android storage technologies (Room database and preferences).
- Camera access is used only to scan barcodes on-device (via Google ML Kit). Camera frames and scan results are not uploaded.
- Notifications and reminders are scheduled locally. If you enable exact alarms in system settings, the app may use them to deliver timely reminders.
- Optional PDF export creates a file on your device. Sharing that PDF uses Android’s system share sheet and is entirely user-initiated.

## Permissions
- Camera: to scan barcodes in app.
- Post notifications: to alert you about upcoming expirations, if you allow notifications.
- Schedule exact alarm: optionally used for precise reminders if enabled in system settings.
- Receive boot completed: to reschedule local reminders after device restart.

## Data sharing
- We do not share your data with third parties. If you choose to share a PDF via another app (e.g., email), that is a user-initiated action handled by the destination app under its own policy.

## Children’s privacy
- Freezr is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children.

## Contact
- For any privacy questions, contact the developer via the email listed on the Google Play store listing.
