# Screenshot plan (Phone & Tablet)

Aim: Tell a simple story across 6–8 images: add → scan → remind → find → label → privacy. Keep device frames clean, high contrast, and legible at small sizes.

General tips
- Use light theme with strong blue accent; keep consistent margins.
- Headline 2–5 words; subhead one line; callouts minimal.
- Show real content (not empty states); avoid clutter.
